# PageSpeed MultiPage

An implementation of Google's PageSpeed Insights API

TODO: Permit querying multiple pages (which is why this project exists)

You need an API key from Google to use their API. You can [get and API key here](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started)

If your API key escapes to the wild (eg you commit it in code), then, armed with your API key, bad folks will be able to spin-up VMs on your account for mining crypto etc.
So, add a restriction to the key as per the below image.
